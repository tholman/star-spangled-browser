# Star Spangled Browser

Are you American? Do you know an American? Do you know of America? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, then this chrome extension is for you!

Just add it to chrome through the chrome web store [here](http://link.com), and you'll never have to hover the word "america" again, without feeling a full blast of American American'ness.
 
### Instructions

Insructions will go here, uncluding how to create new chrome extensions.

#### Customization

Expliation with JS emamples. And examples of asset folders.

#### Packaging

If you have customized this repository, you will need to zip this folder up to submit to the chrome web site. Be sure **not** to include the demo folder, as it is just to show the extension in action, and isn't actually part of it.

You will also need to change the name in the manifest, to something new.
